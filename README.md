# Projects

------- Starting the Data Science Journey ------- 

Hi. Kindly check my projects which allowed me to get my first job in the IT Industry.

### 1. IBM Data Science - Capstone Project

The project's objective is to determine the best option to open a new venue on my local region. Using Foursquare data, I performed an analysis and gave some insights for new entrepreneurs. You can see the report below.

### 2. World Bank Data Analysis

### Model Deployment with SageMaker for different industries at AWS
https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b/discussions/25

Different teams create custom models and deploy them on SageMaker Service to add a competitive advantage to their
business. Custom Models require a high level of customization such as Deep learning container configuration, inference code
adaption and vertical scaling for the hosting instances. I work directly with these teams to help them to leverage SageMaker
Service for these high customization level use cases.

Another approach for model deployment is using pre-trained models from popular providers coming from HuggingFace
Open source repositories. Customers get these pre-trained models and the perform Fine-tunings to improve the model's
output based on a specific knowledge domain.

I invested time to learn how Hugging Face integrates with SageMaker and I provide guidance to the customers and the
ML community when there are issues in the deployment stage. It involves some understanding of the open Source code from 
Hugging Face such as Transformers documentation and SageMaker SDK for Model Deployment.

For this Project, I was able to provide a full fixed guide to deploy the popular “Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b“ open source model. 
I also provided the steps to make predictions with local inputs by using base-64 encoding.

The guide is published on this link: https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b/discussions/25
